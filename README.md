# Predicting_Energy-_Output
This project focuses on predicting the energy output (in Megawatts) of a power plant based on various environmental factors such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and exhaust vacuum. The dataset includes features like ambient temperature, exhaust vacuum pressure, ambient pressure, relative humidity, and net hourly electrical output. We use machine learning models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Residual Networks (ResNet), to predict the energy output, with additional comparisons to other regression algorithms like Random Forest and Linear Regression.

# Data Features:
1. Ambient Temperature (AT): Ranges from 1.81°C to 37.11°C
2. Exhaust Vacuum (V): Ranges from 25.36 to 81.56 cm Hg
3. Ambient Pressure (AP): Ranges from 992.89 to 1033.30 mbar
4. Relative Humidity (RH): Ranges from 25.56% to 100.16%
5. Energy Output (PE): Ranges from 420.26 MW to 495.76 MW (target variable)

# Key Steps:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze and interpret the dataset to identify correlations between features and the energy output.
2. Preprocessing: Prepare the dataset for training by scaling features and splitting into training and testing sets.
3. Model Training: Implement and train an ANN and a ResNet model.
4. Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R², comparing the results with traditional regression models.

# Models:
1. ANN (Artificial Neural Network): A simple neural network with hidden layers using ReLU activation and Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss.
2. ResNet (Residual Network): A deeper architecture using residual blocks with dropout for regularization.
3. Other Regression Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and others for comparison.

# Next Steps:
1. Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters to optimize model performance. Using gridsearchcv
2. Deployment: Create a REST API using Flask or Fast API to deploy the model for real-time predictions.
3. Testing: Add unit tests to validate model predictions and code correctness.
4. Document the models and the usage of the rest API
